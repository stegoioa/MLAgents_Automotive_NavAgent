# MLAgents_Automotive_NavAgent

This repository contains scripts for training an automotive agent to navigate within urban contexts using the [MLAgents toolkit](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents). It also includes functionality for automatically generating mazes for training episodes.

## Requirements

To use this repository, you'll need to have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)
- Unity version 2019.4 or higher
- [MLAgents version 1.5.0](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/releases/tag/release_1.5.0)

Please note that this repository has been tested with Python 3.7 and Miniconda 4.8.3. While it may work with other versions, I recommend using these specific versions to avoid any compatibility issues.

## Usage

To use the scripts in this repository, you'll need to add them to the `Assets` folder of your Unity project. Once you've done that, you can initialize training by using the `AgentScript.cs` script.
